			<h1> Know our<br>
				Global Community

			<p>Connecting to the global community fosters education, collaboration, and the birth of mutually-beneficial programs that make an impact. On the micro level, keeping oneself connected to the global community requires a conscious decision. We can easily live inside a bubble without us even knowing it.</p>

				<p>Since the builder runs in the cloud, there's nothing to install or download, and it's easy to get started quickly. The app builder includes a visual editor using drag and drop components to build the UI. Appery auto-generates the code for any components you drop in. You can connect to any REST API and use it in your app, and instantly add a cloud database and backend to your app if you need to store data.</p>
